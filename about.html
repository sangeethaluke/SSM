          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Hello, and welcome to Saltford School of Motoring.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            My name is Matt Tantram, and I’m proud to provide driving lessons in
            Saltford, Keynsham, and the surrounding areas. Having lived in both
            Saltford and Keynsham all my life, I know the local roads inside out
            and use that knowledge to give my students the best possible
            learning experience.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            With nearly 40 years of driving experience, I bring both skill and
            patience to every lesson. My teaching style is relaxed and
            supportive, helping learners feel at ease behind the wheel so they
            can build confidence at their own pace. I understand that everyone
            learns differently, which is why I focus on creating a calm
            environment where mistakes are simply part of the journey to
            becoming a safe and capable driver.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            For me, it’s not just about passing the driving test—it’s about
            giving you the tools and confidence to drive safely and
            independently for life.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Whether you’re just starting out or looking to brush up on your
            skills, my goal is simple: to help you become a safe, confident
            driver—not just for your test, but for life.
